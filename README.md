  This project is intended to kill two birds with one stone. Learn new technologies and market myself. After developing using JQuery for a year I was curious what else is out there. It does not take alot of research to learn React.js is a good thing to learn. Thus using this and styled-components I decided to give it a try and this is the result. Just as all great things are this is a constant work in progress.
