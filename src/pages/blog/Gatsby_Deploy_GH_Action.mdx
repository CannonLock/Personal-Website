# Deploying Your Gatsby Website with Github Actions

[Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) are a great way to automate all of your code on Github.
Anything that you plan on doing more than once can be automated and leaving
more time for the fun things.

Using the code walked through below you can reliably deploy your [Gatsby
Website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) on Github pages as easily as you push to
a remote repository.

## Create a New Github Action

Adding a workflow to your current repository can be done creating a new yaml
file and adding it to `.github/workflows/<workflow-name\>.yml`. When
this file is pushed to your remote Github Repo you will be able to find a
new action on your repo action page.

## Build the workflow file

You can find details of the breakdown below, or you can bottom of the page
to view the full action file.

### Add a Workflow name
```
name: Gatsby Publish
```

### Add the Workflow Trigger

The trigger is the event that causes our Action to run. In this case I
have set it so that a push to my master branch will result in a new
website build. You can learn more about this in the [workflow syntax docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on).
```
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  ```
### Create Job

This is the where we define what we want to run to the GitHub runner.

1. Set up job

  The first task is to set up the machine for the GHA(GitHub Action) to run
  on. You can view all machine options in the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on)

  ```
    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  ```

2. Checkout the Repository

  This step checks out the repository the action is in so you can access
  its code.

  ```
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  ```

3. Initialize Git User

  This is necessary so that we can push to the deployment branch. The
  checkout action handles branch permissions, so we don't have to worry about
  authentication.
  ```shell
    - name: Initialize GH User
      run: |
        git config user.name "GitHub Actions"
        git config user.email "actions@github.com"
  ```

4. Set Up and Install Node Modules

  Using the package.json file in the websites root we will set up npm and
  install the needed modules to build our website.

  ```shell
    - name: Set Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@master
      with:
        node-version: '16'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
  ```

5. Build the Website

  ```shell
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
  ```

6. Deploy the Website

  First I copy over my CNAME file so that the website is
  served from my custom domain. Next, and this is where it gets especially
  confusing, I create a branch with the built website. To do this I commit
  the built website to the current branch and then use subtree to split the
  'public' subdirectory into its own branch called 'gh-pages'. As gh-pages
  is the branch I serve my website from I then push this branch to origin
  where is published to the world

  ```shell
    - name: Deploy
      run: |
        # Add in the correct CNAME - Optional
        echo "<your-domain>" > public/CNAME

        # Commit the build then use 'git subtree' to create a branch with just the public contents
        git add public -f
        git commit -m "Build Production Website"
        git checkout -b gh-pages `git subtree split --prefix public master`

        # Push to Production
        git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages --force
  ```

## Using the Action

Using this action now can spend less time deploying and more time developing!
You can find the past runs for this action for this website in my
[repository](https://github.com/CannonLock/Personal-Website/actions), and
you can find the actual file [there as well](https://github.com/CannonLock/Personal-Website/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml).

## Gatsby Deployment with GitHub Actions Full Code

```shell
name: Gatsby Publish

on:
    push:
        branches:
            - master

jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            -   uses: actions/checkout@v2

            -   name: Initialize GH User
                run: |
                    git config user.name "GitHub Actions"
                    git config user.email "actions@github.com"

            -   name: Set Node.js
                uses: actions/setup-node@master
                with:
                    node-version: '16'

            -   name: Install dependencies
                run: npm install

            -   name: Build
                run: npm run build

            -   name: Deploy
                run: |
                    # Add in the correct CNAME - Optional
                    echo <your-domain> > public/CNAME

                    # Commit the build then use 'git subtree' to create a branch with just the public contents
                    git add public -f
                    git commit -m "Build Production Website"
                    git checkout -b gh-pages `git subtree split --prefix public master`

                    # Push to Production
                    git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages --force
```
