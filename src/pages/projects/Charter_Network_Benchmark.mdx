# Network Benchmarks

When I come home from work the first thing I do is log onto Zwift
and go for a bike ride. The trainer I have is quite loud, and I live on the
second floor, so it seems like the best time of the day to make noise. The
issue is that I have frequently run into issues with my internet speed not
being adequate to start biking well into the night. As this only seems to
happen after work I have set out to prove the perceived lag is no coincidence.

Null Hypothesis: Download Speeds at 5pm >= Download Speeds at other points
in the day

Alternative Hypothesis: Download Speeds at 5pm < Download Speeds at other
points in the day
