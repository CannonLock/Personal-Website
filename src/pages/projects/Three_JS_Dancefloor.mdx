excerpt: >
  First project using Three JS, a Javascript library for putting 3D content on the web. Well poking around the
  examples I saw one with a mesh dancing and got the idea to incorporate the first 3D mesh I made in Blender.

  The few hours I worked on this makes me far from a pro, so this is just a some links I found helpful.

## Creating the Dance Animation

After spending three hours trying to mesh to wave in a believable way I was not about to try and get it bust a move.
[Adobe Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/) has free to use models and animations, with the animations usable by uploading
your own model. So with little to no effort I had a break dancing model.

I did nothing special well including this model, you can find all the code in the **Dancer** Component in the [DancerFloor.jsx File](https://github.com/CannonLock/Personal-Website/blob/master/src/components/models/DanceFloor.jsx).

The least obvious aspect of the code is the inclusion of the primitive element as seen below.
At this point I don't understand why without this the mesh does not render.

```
<group ref={ref} dispose={null} position={[0,.5,5]} rotation={[Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]} scale={4}>
  <primitive object={nodes?.mixamorigHips} />
  <skinnedMesh
    castShadow
    receiveShadow
    scale={1000}
    geometry={nodes?.Man__Cube004.geometry}
    skeleton={nodes?.Man__Cube004.skeleton}
  >
    <meshStandardMaterial attach={"material"} color={"black"} />
  </skinnedMesh>
</group>
```

Below is a list of the various docs, and code pens that I looked at well building this. There is a lot
of cool things to think about for the future here.
