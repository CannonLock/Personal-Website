excerpt: >
  First project using Three JS, a Javascript library for putting 3D content on the web. Well poking around the
  examples I saw one with a mesh dancing and got the idea to incorporate the first 3D mesh I made in Blender.

  The few hours I worked on this makes me far from a pro, so this is just a some links I found helpful.

import { Display } from "../../components/models/DanceFloor"

## Creating the Dance Animation

After spending three hours trying to mesh to wave in a believable way I was not about to try and get it bust a move.
[Adobe Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/) has free to use models and animations, with the animations usable by uploading
your own model. So with little to no effort I had a break dancing model.

#### Importing the Mixamo File

Mixamo files can be downloaded as .fbx or .dae files, which is not the ideal GLTF format that we want. To
convert the file into a GLTF I chose to load the FBX file into Blender and re-download as a GLTF.

Once downloaded I used the helpers provided by [react-three-drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei#usefbx) to load the model and run the animation.

#### Dancer Component

All of the code can be found in the [DancerFloor.jsx File](https://github.com/CannonLock/Personal-Website/blob/master/src/components/models/DanceFloor.jsx)
, but I have also included the Dancer Component below. I have removed some code specific to my implementation to make the below more general for all Mixamo models.

```
const Dancer = (props) => {
  const dancer = useRef()
  const gltf = useGLTF(DancerFile)
  const {nodes, materials, animations} = gltf
  const { ref, mixer, names, actions, clips } = useAnimations(animations, dancer)

  useEffect(() => {
    actions["Armature|mixamo.com|Layer0"].play()
  });

  return (
    <group ref={ref} dispose={null}>
      <primitive object={nodes?.mixamorigHips} />
      <skinnedMesh
        geometry={nodes?.Man__Cube004.geometry}
        skeleton={nodes?.Man__Cube004.skeleton}
      >
        <meshStandardMaterial attach={"material"} color={"black"} />
      </skinnedMesh>
    </group>
  )
}
```

Below is a list of the various docs, and code pens that I looked at well building this. There is a lot
of cool things to think about for the future here.
